    <h1>Types of Species</h1>
    <p>A species (pl species) is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the 
        appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. It is the 
        basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism, as well as a unit of biodiversity. Other ways
         of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour, or ecological niche.
     In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined.</p><br><hr>
