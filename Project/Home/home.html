        <h1>Gandikota</h1>
    
        <p><i>Endearingly known as the <b>‘Grand Canyon of India’</b>, Gandikota is a small and quaint village in the Kadapa district of <b>Andhra Pradesh, India</b>. Flanked by River Pennar on the right side, the village is famous for the spectacular gorges formed by the river cutting through Erramala Hills. The narrow valleys with streams running between them and the steep rocky walls are reminiscent of the renowned Grand Canyon in Arizona. It requires a walk of almost a kilometre from the main gate to reach the boulder from where you can observe the mesmerising view from the viewpoint near the fort. </i></p>

        <p><i>Located 1.5 hours away from Belum Caves, the highlight of the village of Gandikota is the ruins of Gandikota Fort, which was built in the 13th Century. The sturdy fort is flanked by the Pennar gorges on both sides and is protected by a majestic 5-mile wall. Built-in red sandstone, the fort boasts beautiful, intricate carvings in the interior. It also offers sweeping views of the hills and valleys below. In addition to a granary, jail and ruins of some temples, there are several structures within the fort that you can visit.</i></p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2><hr>
        <p>The fort of Gandikota acquired its name due to the 'gorge', formed between the Erramala range of hills, also known as Gandikota hills and the river Penna (Pennar) that flows at its foot, reducing its width to a mere 100m.</p>

        <h2>Geology</h2><hr>
        <p>Gandikota canyon consists of sedimentary rocks, namely 'Gandikota Quartzite' in the Chitravati Group part of Cuddapah Supergroup. The Chitravati Group consists of three formation rank units: the Pulivendla Quartzite the Tadpatri Formation; and the Gandikota Quartzite.</p>
